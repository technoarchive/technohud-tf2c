## current state: usable, but very little work done on tf2c-specifics (check todo list in issues for progress)

a clean hud made (mostly) from scratch with darker neutral colors as a theme.

but this time i ported it to tf2 ~~classic~~ classified

currently based on [1.0A](https://github.com/tekunotri/technohud/releases/tag/1.0A)
